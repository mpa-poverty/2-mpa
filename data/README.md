# Data 
This folder contains 5 different `csv` files.  
- `dataset.csv` has all asset wealth index - points recorded. We can use it to download the multispectral images.  
- `madagascar_train_dataset.csv` and `madagascar_test_dataset.csv` form a split of the previous one, to evaluate the methods on madagascar points from the latest years.  
- `dhsnl_locs.csv` is derived from `dataset.csv` with a few less columns and is used with respect to Yeh's preprocessing pipeline.
- `geometries.csv` adds coordinates of the bounding boxes for every point to the previous `csv` file.
